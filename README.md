# Password-Generator-
Password Generator (in progress)
 ## Objective 
 I wanted to create a password generator that would ask for:
 * length of characters in the password between 8 - 128
 * It will confirm Upper Case letters
 * It will confirm lower case letters
 * It will confirm numbers
 * It will confirm special characters (!,@,#, etc.)
 
 ## Javascript
 I was able to:
 * Create the arrays for the prompts
 * create confirms for each character type with functions
 
 I am in progress with:
 * Taking function return from confirms and generating the password.
